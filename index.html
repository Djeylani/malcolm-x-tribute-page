                <ul class="tribute-list">
                    <li>1925
                        May 19: Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of Earl and Louise
                        Little's seven children. Earl, a Baptist minister, is a follower of Marcus Garvey's black
                        nationalism and serves as Omaha chapter president of Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement
                        Association. Louise Little serves as the division secretary.</li>
                    <li>1926
                        December: The Littles leave Omaha and move to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</li>
                    <li>1928
                        The Littles move again, this time to Lansing, Michigan. Settling in a white neighborhood, they
                        are sued for eviction on the basis that a restrictive covenant prevents their home from being
                        sold to any non-Caucasians.<br />November 7: The Little house is burned to the ground. No fire
                        wagon is dispatched to the scene. Looking back Malcolm believes that a local white supremacist
                        group was behind it.</li>
                    <li>1931
                        September 28: Louise has a premonition about her husband and asks him not to leave the house.
                        Later that night, Earl Little is killed in what police term a streetcar accident, but Malcolm
                        later says that the Ku Klux Klan was behind it. After Earl's death, his wife and children
                        struggle to make ends meet and must apply for public assistance.</li>
                    <li>1938
                        December 23: Louise Little is diagnosed as mentally ill and sent to the Kalamazoo State Mental
                        Hospital, where she will stay for 26 years.</li>
                    <li>1939
                        The state places the Little children with various foster families, and Malcolm, who has been
                        kicked out of school in the seventh grade, is sent to a juvenile home in the nearly all-white
                        community of Mason, Michigan. He does well at school there, earning straight A's and being
                        elected president of his 8th-grade class, but his teacher discourages him about pursuing his
                        goal of becoming a lawyer.</li>
                    <li>1940
                        Summer: Fifteen-year-old Malcolm visits his half-sister Ella Collins in the Roxbury neighborhood
                        of Boston and is entranced. "I couldn't have feigned indifference if I had tried to," he later
                        says. "I didn't know the world contained as many Negroes as I saw thronging downtown Roxbury at
                        night."</li>
                    <li>1941
                        February: Ella Collins gains custody of Malcolm and he moves to Boston. Over the next few years,
                        he works a number of odd jobs on railroads, in restaurants and bars, at shoeshine stands, and in
                        a jewelry store. Malcolm learns to dress like a hipster, dyes his hair, and starts hustling in
                        Boston (where he's known as "New York Red"), New York (where the nickname is "Detroit Red"), and
                        Detroit.</li>
                    <li>1943
                        October 25: Malcolm, who has responded to his draft notice by loudly proclaiming that he wants
                        to "fight for the Japanese" and kill whites, is found mentally unfit for military service and
                        classified 4F.</li>
                    <li>1944
                        Malcolm has his first run in with the courts. He is sentenced to four months in jail and one
                        year of probation for larceny.</li>
                    <li>1946
                        January: Malcolm tries to retrieve a stolen $1000 watch from a pawnshop and is arrested and
                        charged with grand larceny, breaking and entering, and firearms possession. He is convicted and,
                        along with Jarvis, receives an eight-to-10-year sentence. The white women have their sentences
                        suspended, but Malcolm's girlfriend serves seven months in prison. The women refused the police
                        suggestion to charge Malcolm and Malcolm Jarvis with rape.<br /><br />February: At the age of
                        20, Malcolm is sent to jail in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and assigned prisoner number 22843.
                        He will remain behind bars until 1952.</li>
                    <li>1947
                        Malcolm meets a fellow convict he calls "Bimbi," who convinces Malcolm to study and learn to
                        develop his mind. In Jarvis' words, in prison "the only way we knew how to rebel was to cram
                        some knowledge into our brains."</li>
                    <li>1948
                        Malcolm's siblings, four of whom have converted to Islam, introduce him to the words of the
                        Nation of Islam's leader, Elijah Muhammad, who is himself in prison for sedition and violation
                        of the draft laws. The two men correspond, and Malcolm continues his course of study, eventually
                        writing to the Massachusetts governor and demanding the right to practice Islam in prison. He
                        also joins the prison debate team and begins attracting attention for his oratory.</li>
                    <li>1952
                        August 7: Malcolm is released on parole, spends one night with Ella Collins, then goes to
                        Detroit to live with his brother Wilfred. He quickly joins the Nation of Islam and attends
                        meetings at Detroit's Temple No. 1, one of the four temples that the Nation operates at the
                        time. Malcolm rejects the surname "Little" as a slave name given to his family by white
                        oppressors, and he becomes known as "Malcolm X." Dismayed that the Nation of Islam is not
                        attracting more followers (at the time, total nationwide membership was about 400), Malcolm
                        begins an intensive recruiting campaign with Elijah Muhammad's blessing. Soon membership in the
                        Nation begins to soar.</li>
                    <li>1953
                        August: Having tripled the membership of the Detroit temple in under a year, Malcolm is
                        appointed assistant minister there. <br /> <br />September: Elijah Muhammad sends Malcolm back
                        to Boston to serve as first minister of its Temple No. 11. He goes on to organize temples along
                        the East Coast, including in Hartford and Philadelphia, attracting new members wherever he
                        speaks.</li>

                    <li>1954
June: Elijah Muhammad gives Malcolm his highest appointment to date, chief minister of Harlem's Temple No. 7. In Malcolm's words, "For Mr. Muhammad's teachings really to resurrect American black people, Islam obviously had to grow, to grow very big. And nowhere in America was such a single Temple potential available as in New York's five boroughs." Thanks in large part to Malcolm's charisma and tireless recruiting, within the next five years membership in the Nation of Islam swells to 40,000 and supports 49 temples.</li>
                    <li><span>1955</span>
                        Malcolm X attends the first Conference of the Non-aligned Nations in Bandung, Indonesia.</li>
                    <li>1956
                        Malcolm's future wife Betty Sanders becomes a member of the Harlem Temple and adopts the name "Betty X." They will marry two years later, after Malcolm proposes by phone from a Detroit gas station, and take up residence in East Elmhurst, Queens.</li>
                    <li>1957
                        April 14: New York Temple member Johnson Hinton is savagely beaten by police. Alerted by other followers, Malcolm joins a contingent of Muslims at the 28th Precinct headquarters in Harlem, where he demands that Hinton receive medical attention. Hinton is eventually taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, but the Muslims refuse to disperse, which alarms police. Satisfied that his demands have been met, Malcolm disperses the crowd with a wave of his hand. He later sues New York City for police brutality and wins the largest settlement in its history. Media coverage of the Hinton incident brings Malcolm national attention, and the FBI, which has kept a file on Malcolm since 1953, now considers him a "key figure" meriting significant surveillance. Police harassment of Malcolm and his family escalates.</li>
                    <li>1958
                        Malcolm and Betty X's first child, Attalah, is born</li>
                    <li>1959
                        Spring-Summer: Malcolm makes his first trips abroad, visiting Ghana, Sudan, Nigeria, Iran, Syria, Egypt, and the United Arab Republic; illness prevents him from traveling to Mecca. Meets with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt.
                        
                        July 13: New York television begins airing a five-part documentary by Mike Wallace entitled The Hate that Hate Produced, which Wallace calls "a study of the rise of black racism, of a call for black supremacy among a small but growing segment of the American Negro population." Elijah Muhammad has been against participating in the program, but Malcolm talks him into it. Despite its negative tone, the documentary spurs increased interest and growing membership in the Nation of Islam. In Malcolm's words, "it seems that everywhere I went telephones were ringing." But the Nation's higher profile alarms many in both the white community and the nascent civil rights movement.</li>
                    <li>1961
                        Elijah Muhammad, who has moved from Chicago to Phoenix for health reasons, makes Malcolm national representative of the Nation of Islam. This creates resentment among Muhammad's inner circle who do not want Malcolm to be the next leader. Malcolm is increasingly asked to lecture on college campuses (eventually he will trail only Barry Goldwater in popularity as a speaker there) and participate in television and radio debates.</li>
